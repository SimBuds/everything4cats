/**
 * Plugin Name: Everything4Cats Compliance
 * Description: Affiliate disclosure, sponsored/nofollow tagging and Article schema. Deliberately a plugin, not theme code.
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Requires PHP: 7.4
 * Author: SimBuds
 * License: GPL-2.0-or-later
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PLUGIN
 *
 * This started life inside a theme, in a file whose own comment said it was
 * "kept in its own file ... so a future theme change can carry it forward".
 * That change arrived on 2026-08-10 when the project pivoted to
 * Everything4Cats and a different base theme, and the prediction held: the
 * disclosure, the sponsored-link tagging and the Article schema are the parts
 * that must not die with a theme.
 *
 * They are legal and structural obligations, not presentation. Switch a theme
 * and the site should still tag paid links and still disclose. So they live
 * here, where deactivating them is a deliberate act rather than a side effect
 * of changing how the site looks.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *
 * 1. `rel="sponsored nofollow"` on links to monetised domains written into
 *    article prose — structural, so it does not depend on an author
 *    remembering.
 * 2. A per-article disclosure above the first paragraph. A site-wide footer bar
 *    is not a substitute: both the FTC and the Competition Bureau want a
 *    disclosure the reader meets *before* acting on a link, and a bar below the
 *    fold is after every link on the page.
 * 3. Article JSON-LD, carrying author and dates, with no `aggregateRating` —
 *    marking up an affiliate comparison as a rating is what Google's
 *    self-serving-review policy prohibits, and the penalty is a manual action.
 *
 * Both 1 and 2 key off ONE filterable list of monetised domains rather than off
 * "any outbound link". That distinction was learned the expensive way on the
 * previous project: the first version tagged editorial citations as paid
 * placements and printed a disclosure on articles that earned nothing. Both are
 * misstatements, and on a site whose credibility is the product they are the
 * expensive kind.
 *
 * The list is EMPTY by default, so nothing is tagged and no disclosure renders
 * until a programme is actually joined:
 *
 *     add_filter( 'e4c_compliance_affiliate_domains', function ( $d ) {
 *         $d[] = 'chewy.com';
 *         $d[] = 'amazon.com';
 *         return $d;
 *     } );
 *
 * @package Everything4Cats

/**
 * Domains whose links are monetised.
 *
 * Empty by default and filterable, so the list is configuration rather than a
 * code edit. Add hosts through the `e4c_compliance_affiliate_domains` filter as
 * programmes are joined.
 *
 * This list is what separates a paid link from a citation, and both the `rel`
 * filter and the disclosure key off it. Before it existed, every outbound link
 * was treated as an affiliate link, which marked editorial citations as paid
 * placements and printed an affiliate disclosure on articles that earned
 * nothing. Both are misstatements, and on a site whose credibility is the
 * product they are the expensive kind.

 * Emit Article structured data on single posts and pages.
 *
 * A theme's single-post template typically shows a publication line and, when a
 * post has been edited after publishing, a reviewed date. Those are readable by
 * a person and invisible to a search engine, which is the gap this closes.
 * Product reviews age, and a review whose freshness a search engine cannot read
 * is judged as though it were never updated.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative about what it claims:
 *
 * - `Article`, not `NewsArticle` or `Review`. The stricter types carry
 *   expectations this site does not meet, and a type that overstates what a page
 *   is invites a manual action rather than a rich result.
 * - `dateModified` is emitted only when the post really was modified after
 *   publication, matching the visible line exactly. A `dateModified` equal to
 *   `datePublished` on every post is noise that claims freshness nobody earned.
 * - No `aggregateRating`, no `Review`, no `priceRange`. This site will carry
 *   affiliate comparisons, and the temptation to mark them up as ratings is
 *   exactly what Google's structured-data policy on self-serving reviews
 *   prohibits.
