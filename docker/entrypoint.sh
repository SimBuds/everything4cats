# --- SSH key ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Why copy rather than mount straight to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys: a
# bind-mounted file keeps its ownership from the host (your user, uid 1000).
# sshd's StrictModes rejects an authorized_keys file that root does not own, and
# the failure surfaces as "Permission denied (publickey)" with nothing useful in
# the client output. Copying it into place with the right ownership avoids
# turning StrictModes off, which would be disabling a real security control to
# work around a local packaging detail.

# --- host keys --------------------------------------------------------------
# The container's own identity, as opposed to the key that authenticates you to
# it. These live in a named volume so they outlive a rebuild. Keys written into
# /etc/ssh would be image content, changing on every build, and the client is
# right to refuse a server whose identity changed. Generating them once here is
# the container equivalent of a real server keeping its host keys across a
# reprovision.

# --- database ---------------------------------------------------------------
# /var/lib/mysql is a named volume, so its contents outlive the image. A rebuild
# can therefore hand MySQL a data directory created by a previous container. The
# chown guards against the mysql user's uid differing between image builds, which
# fails as a refusal to start with the reason buried in /var/log/mysql/error.log
# rather than on stdout. Cheap on a small database, and idempotent.

# --- web tier --------------------------------------------------------------
# The php-fpm service name carries the PHP version, so it is discovered rather
# than hardcoded. An empty result is a hard failure: starting Apache without
# php-fpm produces a site that serves PHP source as plain text, which looks like
# a template bug rather than a missing service.

# would 404 with no indication why. Provisioning core files here makes the
# environment reproducible with one command.
#
# wp-config.php is deliberately NOT created. It holds the database password, and
# generating it would mean sourcing that credential from the image, this file, or
# an env var sitting next to them in the repository. Tier 0 forbids secrets at
# rest, so creating it stays a manual step, documented in the README under
